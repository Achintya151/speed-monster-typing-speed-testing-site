                        <p>A session Storage object for the current origin can be accessed using the read-only
                            sessionStorage attribute. Similar to local storage, session storage has the advantage that
                            its contents are deleted when the page session ends, unlike local storage, which keeps its
                            contents forever.

                            <li>Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session
                                gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for
                                that particular tab.</li>
                            <li>A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page
                                reloads and restores.</li>
                            <li>Opening a page in a new tab or window creates a new session with the value of the
                                top-level browsing context, which differs from how session cookies work.</li>
                            <li>Opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates sessionStorage for each
                                tab/window.</li>
                            <li>Duplicating a tab copies the tab's sessionStorage into the new tab.</li>
                            <li>Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in sessionStorage.</li>

                        What are the Differences between Global scope and Block scope?
                    </div>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl">Global Scope</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes
                            by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not
                            contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer.

                            Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. Any variables assigned without
                            an explicit scope (using the var, let, or const keywords) automatically become global
                            variables. The same is true for functions.
                            In the global scope, any variable can overwrite any other variable at any time. This is why
                            creating global variables and global functions in Javascript is potentially dangerous. The
                            Javascript interpreter does not check to make sure that a variable or function name exists,
                            so you might accidentally overwrite an important built-in Javascript function or property.

                            The Javascript global scope is critical to run programs properly, but developers should
                            never create global variables or global functions in production code, especially in large
                            projects. It is not dangerous to create global functions and variables in small, isolated
                            test cases. Anytime someone else will use your code, using the global scope is a risky
                            choice.</p>

                        <h2 class="text-2xl">Block Scope</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally
                            speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords
                            allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist
                            only within the corresponding block.</p>

                        How does Javascript event loop works?

                    <div class="collapse-content">

                        <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing
                            callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                            triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it
                            to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
